# Signature Verifier

---

_This project is an implementation of EIP712. Signatures are created on a Buy method where the contract verifies the signatures. A dummy nonce manager is implemented in the contract to avoid same nonces being reused._

-   hardhat.config.js is kept simple on purpose (no networks, no gas reporter, etc.)
-   Contract documentation can be found [here](docs/index.md).
